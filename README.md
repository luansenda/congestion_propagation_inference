## congestion_propagation_inference
### Two parts
* 1st: congestion network structure learning using R language (Attempts are being made to convert it to Python for readability)
    *  data input: net_2.csv
    *  structure_learning_bn.R
* 2nd: congestion network parameter learning using Python language (based on the environment of Pytorch)
    *  data input: the data file
    *  gcns.py
    *  dbgcn_utils.py
    *  train.py
    *  test.py
